# AFIP Client

This is a Argetina's AFIP Client communicate to their Business WS

**THIS IS AN ALPHA 1, NOT A PRODUCTION MODULE YET BUT ALMOST, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**

**IMPORTANT: This module is currently using a PHP code snipped to Sign the TRA (ticket de requerimiento de autenticaciÃ³n), planned to be replace with pure node code soon**

Development on this module started June 22, 2016. We are scheduling to release a beta version by July 15th, we are now open for bugs, suggestions and pull requests.

Keep watching!
