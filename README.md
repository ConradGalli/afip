# AFIP Client

This is a Argetina's [AFIP WS](http://www.afip.gov.ar/ws/) Client to communicate to their Business Web Services.

**THIS IS AN ALPHA 2, NOT A PRODUCTION MODULE YET BUT ALMOST A BETA, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**

**IMPORTANT: This module is currently using a PHP code snipped to Sign the TRA (ticket de requerimiento de autenticaciÃ³n), planned to be replace with pure node code soon**

Development on this module started June 22, 2016. We are scheduling to release a beta version by July 15th, we are now open for bugs, suggestions and pull requests.

Keep watching!


## Install

Install with [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):

## Module

This module provides a constructor method that gives you an instance of a WS SOAP Client (See: [SOAP Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/soap))


### initSession(options, callback)

Starts a session with WSAA Afip and creates a Client for a given Business Service.


#### Options

The `options` argument allows you to customize the client with the following properties:

- `service`: Any related business service to authenticate to associated to the CUIT, ie: wsfe
- `serviceClass`: Business service class to use as root path, ie: wsfev1
- `productionCertFilename`: absolute location to your production cert file
- `productionKeyFilename`:  absolute location to your production private key file
- `productionPassphrase`: *Optional, default empty* - passphrase used to generate the production key file
- `homologCertFilename`:  absolute location to your homolog cert file
- `homologKeyFilename`:  absolute location to your homolog private key file
- `homologPassphrase`: *Optional, default empty* - passphrase used to generate the homolog key file

* See [AFIP WS Documentation](http://www.afip.gov.ar/ws/) to learn how to get your cert files and relate business services to your *clave fiscal*

The callback will receive the following parameters:
